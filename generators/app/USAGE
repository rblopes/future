Description:
  Creates a Phaser Web game project, featuring a live development environment
  ready for ES2015+ and cross-device testing.

Available Sub-generators:
  - object: Creates an extended game object class
  - plugin: Creates a custom plugin class
  - scene: Creates a new game scene class

  To run a sub-generator, use:

  > yo phaser-plus:<sub-generator>

Hint:
  The generator will automatically detect and use the package manager Yarn, if
  available. If you want to install and manage dependencies using npm instead,
  use the flag `--no-yarn`.
